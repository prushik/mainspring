Mainspring Data Types

Unlike most other languages, Mainspring's simple data types, do not 
attempt to represent the type of data stored in them, instead, they 
represent only the size of the data.

# byte
8 bits

# word
16 bits

# dword
32 bits

# qword
64 bits. Since Mainspring runs only on 64 bit systems, qwords are also 
used to store memory addresses.

# 80
This data type can only used for operations on 80 bit registers.

# registers
In addition to the Mainsprings data size keywords, Mainspring also 
allows specifying register names as size keywords. If a register name 
is used to declare a variable, Mainspring guarentees that register will 
be used to store the value of the variable. Mainspring will attempt to 
ensure that no other variables will overwrite the specified register, 
however, there are cases where this is not possible. If such a case 
arises, the Mainspring compiler will issue a warning. If multiple 
variables are declared occupying the same register, the variables will 
point to the same value.
