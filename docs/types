Mainspring Data Types

Unlike most other languages, Mainspring's simple data types, do not 
attempt to represent the type of data stored in them, instead, they 
represent only the size of the data.

# byte
8 bits

# word
16 bits

# dword
32 bits

# qword
64 bits


# 80
This data type can only used for operations on 80 bit registers.
