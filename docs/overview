Mainspring Language Overview

The Mainspring programming language aims to give programmers as much 
power as possible, never limiting what can be done, and to be as fast 
as possible, and as simple to write as possible. Mainspring accomplishes 
this by being very close to the hardware, but still allowing higher 
level concepts. However, unlike most higher level languages, Mainspring 
allows programmers a high degree of control over how higher level 
constructs function.
